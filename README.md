# My Pet Flask

[![clicky](https://github.com/kennedy/my_pet_flask/actions/workflows/python-clicky.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kennedy/my_pet_flask/actions/workflows/python-clicky.yml)

There is no reason for this project. I got bored and wanted to incrementally build a project from scratch.

day 1: make basic flask app
day 2: add database and github actions
day 3: More github actions

1. making a flask app with hello world
1. use github actions to build, lint, and test


TODO:

- [ ] Make basic flask
- [ ] Make Github Actions, Multiple versions
- [ ] Add batabase with sqlalchemy, or most likely a graph database to learn
- [ ] Static site gen perhaps?
- [ ] 11ty?
